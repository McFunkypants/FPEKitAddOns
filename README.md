# FPEKitAddOns
A set of free add-ons for users of First Person Exploration Kit.

# Overview 
Each folder contains a file called Requirements.txt. This file lists the Unity version, First Person Exploration Kit version, and other package dependencies (with versions) required for that add on to work.


# IMPORTANT NOTE
All add-ons that rely on 3rd party packages (e.g. Cinemachine) should be considered in permanent Beta. Support will be provided where possible, but external 3rd party updates may change how the add-on behaves.



# Elevator
A sample project that uses elevator floors to switch scenes.

# Teleport
A simple single scene teleporter. Works like default Doorways, but does not load a new scene or save/load data. Good for cinematic hard cuts, etc.
