# FPEKitAddOns
A set of free add-ons for users of First Person Exploration Kit.

# Overview 
Each folder contains a file called Requirements.txt. This file lists the Unity version, First Person Exploration Kit version, and other package dependencies (with versions) required for that add on to work.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
All add-ons below that rely on other packages should be considered in permanent Beta. Support will be provided where possible, but some stuff may just stop working as external dependencies change


# Elevator
A sample project that uses elevator floors to switch scenes.

# FPEKitCinemachine
A basic integration of a Cinemachine-driven cutscene camera with First Person Exploration Kit v2.0.2

# Teleport
A simple single scene teleporter. Works like default Doorways, but does not load a new scene or save/load data. Good for cinematic hard cuts, etc.
